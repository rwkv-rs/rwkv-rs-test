# RWKV Lightning API 测试脚本
# ============================================================================
# 
# 此脚本测试以下API端点：
# 1. /translate/v1/batch-translate - 批量翻译（非流式）
# 2. /v1/chat/completions          - V1：基础批处理（支持流式和非流式）
# 3. /v2/chat/completions          - V2：连续批处理（支持流式和非流式）
# 
# 使用方法：
#   bash test_curl.sh        # 执行所有测试
#
